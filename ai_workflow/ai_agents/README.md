# AI Agent WORKFLOW

The AI Agent API is a comprehensive solution for designing, developing, and deploying AI agents for blockchain use cases. It provides a suite of endpoints to manage AI agents, identify objectives, design workflows, generate codebases, and retrieve relevant data such as chat history and NFT market modeling.

## 🛠️ **How Our Agentic Workflow Operates**

1. **User Prompt and Objective Identification 🤔✨**

   - The user begins by entering their use case as a prompt.
   - An **Objective Identification Agent** kicks in to uncover the user's goals and aspirations related to blockchain.
   - It assigns each identified objective to a team of **domain-specific experts** selected from an expert pool.

2. **Expert Analysis and Feedback Loop 🧑‍💻🔍**

   - Each assigned expert dives into their respective objective.
   - They analyze what **technical design settings** are required, determine what can be inferred from the user's input, and identify gaps.
   - For missing parameters, they loop back to the user for feedback, ensuring a **complete and accurate objective design**.

3. **Architecture Planning and Structuring 🏗️📂**

   - Once the objectives are finalized, the **Architecture Planning Agent** takes charge.
   - It drafts the **codebase structure**, outlining:
     - File arrangements
     - Directory structure
     - A clear description of each file’s purpose
   - This ensures a well-organized and scalable solution.

4. **Code Implementation by Coder Agent 💻🤖**
   - The **Coder Agent** steps in to handle the heavy lifting.
   - It meticulously writes and finalizes the code, weaving the agents' collaborative efforts into a blockchain solution tailored to the user's use case.

This agentic process ensures **seamless collaboration**, **iterative refinement**, and a robust end-to-end blockchain solution for every user! 🚀
